        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Uma Dairy was initiated in 2025 as a small family business. Initially, we operated offline, selling fresh and high-quality dairy products directly to our community.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Over the years, our passion for quality and customer satisfaction has helped us grow and connect with more customers. Today, we are embracing technology to bring the same trusted products right to your doorstep.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          We remain committed to sustainable farming practices, supporting local farmers, and delivering the freshest dairy products to every home.
